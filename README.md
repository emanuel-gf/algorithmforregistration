# algorithm for registration

Welcome to the algorithm to registrate products, employees, customers and sales.
The registers are stored in dictionaries, you can access by the numeric key displayed when the program is running.
For sales, when the customer is an employee, there´s a 10% of discount applied to this person
The discount is calculate directly by: (1-10%)=0.9, so the discount just multiplies by 0.9 at the price*quantity
The script it´s in the initial fase. Some next steps could be encapsulating classes attributes and implementing
a search mechanism to alter incorrect sales, by searching via sales Id.
For advices and complains, feel free to send an email to: emanuelgoulartf@gmail.com
